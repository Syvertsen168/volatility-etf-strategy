# Volatility-Aware ETF Trading Bot

A Python-based algorithmic trading strategy that rotates among ETFs (QQQ, IWM, VWO) using simple moving average (SMA) signals, while dynamically rotating to cash during high-volatility periods. The strategy uses Alpaca's Paper Trading API for live trading simulation and backtesting with historical data from Yahoo Finance.

##  Strategy Logic

This strategy allocates to ETFs only when:
1. **Short-term trend (50-day SMA)** is above the **long-term trend (200-day SMA)**.
2. **Market volatility** is below the 80th percentile over the past year.

When volatility exceeds the threshold, the portfolio exits positions and rotates fully to **cash**.

## Strategy Overview

This strategy blends trend-following signals with a volatility-aware overlay:

- **Technical Signal**: If the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, the ETF is considered in an uptrend and eligible for allocation.
- **Weighting**: Allocations are distributed equally among qualifying ETFs.
- **Volatility Filter**: If the average volatility exceeds the 80th percentile of the last year, all ETF weights go to zero (cash rotation).
- **Rebalancing**: Scheduled daily via the `schedule` package.
